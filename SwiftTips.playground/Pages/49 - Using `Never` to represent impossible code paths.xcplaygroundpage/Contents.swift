/*
 `Never` is quite a peculiar type in the Swift Standard
 Library: it is defined as an empty enum `enum Never { }`.
 
 While this might seem odd at first glance, it actually
 yields a very interesting property: it makes it a type
 that cannot be constructed (i.e. it possesses no instances).
 
 This way, `Never` can be used as a generic parameter to
 let the compiler know that a particular feature will not
 be used.
