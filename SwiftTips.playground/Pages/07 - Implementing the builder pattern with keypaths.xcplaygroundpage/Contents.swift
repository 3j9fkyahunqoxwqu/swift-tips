/*
 With the addition of keypaths in Swift 4, it is now possible
 to easily implement the builder pattern, that allows the
 developer to clearly separate the code that initializes a value
 from the code that uses it, without the burden of defining a
 factory method.
 
 ðŸš¨ The Swift compiler **does not** perform OS availability checks
 on properties referenced by keypaths. Any attempt to use a `KeyPath`
 for an unavailable property will result in a runtime crash.
