 `UIKit` exposes a very powerful and simple API to perform
 view animations. However, this API can become a little bit
 quirky to use when we want to perform animations sequentially,
 because it involves nesting closure within one another, which
 produces notoriously hard to maintain code.
 
 Nonetheless, it's possible to define a rather simple class,
 that will expose a really nicer API for this particular use case ðŸ‘Œ
