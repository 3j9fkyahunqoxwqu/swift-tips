/*
 Almost all Apple devices able to run Swift code are powered
 by a multi-core CPU, consequently making a good use of
 parallelism is a great way to improve code performance.
 `map()` is a perfect candidate for such an optimization,
 because it is almost trivial to implement a parallel version.
 
 ðŸš¨ Make sure to only use `parallelMap()` when the `transform`
 function actually performs some costly computations. Otherwise
 performances will be systematically slower than using `map()`
 because of the multithreading overhead.
